Multi-Layer Perceptron for regression using Mocha
=================================================

This repository contains a simple implementation of a multi-layer perceptron for estimating
a mathematical function using the Mocha framework for the Julia programming language.

For a more detailed explanation, you can refer to the corresponding post on my blog
